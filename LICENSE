I hereby acknowledge the original design of eBoto, which was written by Nephia Bianca Dalisay and Patricia Bueno. Some design concepts such as the notion of an Election Authority and the possible actions of the election authority were re-used, but as far as actual code is concerned, this is a full re-implementation.

However, several libraries used are under different licenses, such as web3.js being under the LGPLv3.

In order to avoid causing dependency conflicts and broken environments, these libraries are not distributed with the eBoto2 source code in the source tree, so their licenses do not apply to the source code form of eBoto2. However, they are distributed inside the development VM (in the releases).
